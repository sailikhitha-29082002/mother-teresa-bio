    <p>Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu MC (born Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu, Albanian: [aˈɲɛzə ˈɡɔndʒɛ bɔjaˈdʒi.u]; 26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997), better known as Mother 
        Teresa,[a] was an Albanian-Indian Catholic nun and the founder of the Missionaries of Charity. Born in Skopje, then part of the Ottoman Empire,[b] at 
        the age of 18 she moved to Ireland and later to India, where she lived most of her life. On 4 September 2016, she was canonised by the Catholic Church
         as Saint Teresa of Calcutta. The anniversary of her death, 5 September, is her feast day.

    <p>Agnes had completed her schooling from Private Catholic School in the Albanian language. She was very attractive when she was young. She had brown eyes, 
        which made her charming and attractive. Also, she was a brilliant scholar and always got the first rank.She studied nursing and started working in the slums. 
        In 1948 she founded the Missionaries of Charity, a religious order of women dedicated to serving the poor. Mother Teresa led the order for nearly 50 years.
        It opened schools for children and centers to treat the blind, the disabled, the old, and the dying. Mother Teresa founded Missionaries of Charity, a religious congregation, which grew to have over 
        4,500 nuns across 133 countries as of 2012.[6] The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and tuberculosis. The congregation also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries,
        mobile clinics, children's and family counselling programmes, as well as orphanages and schools. Members take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to give 
        "wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor."[7]Mother Teresa received several honours, including the 1962 Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize and the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. 
        A controversial figure during her life and after her death, Mother Teresa was admired by many for her charitable work, but was criticised for her views on abortion and contraception, as well as the poor
        conditions in her houses for the dying. Her authorised biography, written by Navin Chawla, was published in 1992, and she has been the subject of many other works. On 6 September 2017, Mother Teresa and 
        Saint Francis Xavier were named co-patrons of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta.On 7 October 1950, Mother Teresa received Vatican permission for the diocesan congregation, which would become the Missionaries of Charity.[44] In her words, it would care for "the hungry, the naked, the homeless,
        the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone".[45]
        In 1952, Mother Teresa opened her first hospice with help from Calcutta officials. She converted an abandoned Hindu temple
        into the Kalighat Home for the Dying, free for the poor, and renamed it Kalighat, the Home of the Pure Heart (Nirmal Hriday).[46]
        Those brought to the home received medical attention and the opportunity to die with dignity in accordance with their faith: Muslims were to read the Quran, Hindus received water from the Ganges,
        and Catholics received extreme unction.[47] "A beautiful death", Mother Teresa said, "is for people who lived like animals to die like angels—loved and wanted."[47]

    <p>On 10 September 1946, Teresa experienced what she later described as "the call within the call" when she travelled by train to the Loreto convent in Darjeeling from Calcutta for her annual retreat. "I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them. 
        It was an order. To fail would have been to break the faith."[36] Joseph Langford, MC, founder of her congregation of priests, the Missionaries of Charity Fathers, later wrote, "Though no one knew it at the time, Sister Teresa had just become Mother Teresa".[37]
        She began missionary work with the poor in 1948,[25] replacing her traditional Loreto habit with a simple, white cotton sari with a blue border. Mother Teresa adopted Indian citizenship, spent several months in Patna to receive basic medical training at Holy Family Hospital and ventured into the slums.[38][39] 
        She founded a school in Motijhil, Calcutta, before she began tending to the poor and hungry.[40] At the beginning of 1949, Mother Teresa was joined in her effort by a group of young women, and she laid the foundation for a new religious community helping the "poorest among the poor".[41]
        Her efforts quickly caught the attention of Indian officials, including the prime minister.[42] Mother Teresa wrote in her diary that her first year was fraught with difficulty. With no income, she begged for food and supplies and experienced doubt, loneliness and the temptation to return to the comfort of convent life during these early months: 
        Mother Teresa said, "By blood, I am Albanian. By citizenship, an Indian. By faith, I am a Catholic nun. As to my calling, I belong to the world. On 7 October 1950, Mother Teresa received Vatican permission for the diocesan congregation, which would become the Missionaries of Charity.[44] In her words, it would care for "the hungry, the naked, the homeless, 
        the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone".[45]In 1952, Mother Teresa opened her first hospice with help from Calcutta officials. She converted an abandoned Hindu temple into the Kalighat Home for the Dying, free for the poor, and renamed it Kalighat, the Home of the Pure Heart (Nirmal Hriday).[46] Those brought to the home received medical attention and the opportunity to die with dignity in accordance with their faith: Muslims were to read the Quran, Hindus received water from the Ganges, and Catholics received extreme unction.[47] "A beautiful death", Mother Teresa said, "is for people who lived like animals to die like angels—loved and wanted."[47]
        As to my heart, I belong entirely to the Heart of Jesus."[4] Fluent in five languages – Bengali,[57] Albanian, Serbian, English and Hindi – she made occasional trips outside India for humanitarian reasons.[58] 
        These included, in 1971, a visit with four of her sisters, to Troubles-era Belfast. Her suggestion that the conditions she had found justified an ongoing mission was the cause of some embarrassment.[59] 
        Reportedly under pressure from senior clergy, who believed "the missionary traffic should be in other direction", and despite local welcome and support, she and her sisters abruptly left the city in 1973.[60][61]
        At the height of the Siege of Beirut in 1982, Mother Teresa rescued 37 children trapped in a front-line hospital by brokering a temporary cease-fire between the Israeli army and Palestinian guerrillas.[62] 
        Accompanied by Red Cross workers, she travelled through the war zone to the hospital to evacuate the young patients.[63]
        When Eastern Europe experienced increased openness in the late 1980s, Mother Teresa expanded her efforts to Communist countries which had rejected the Missionaries of Charity. She began dozens of projects, undeterred by criticism of her stands against abortion and divorce: 
        "No matter who says what, you should accept it with a smile and do your own work". She visited Armenia after the 1988 earthquake[64] and met with Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov.[65]
        Mother Teresa travelled to assist the hungry in Ethiopia, radiation victims at Chernobyl and earthquake victims in Armenia.[66][67][68] In 1991 she returned to Albania for the first time, opening a Missionaries of Charity Brothers home in Tirana.[69]
        By 1996, the Missionaries of Charity operated 517 missions in over 100 countries.[70] The number of sisters in the Missionaries of Charity grew from twelve to thousands, serving the "poorest of the poor" in 450 centres worldwide. 
        The first Missionaries of Charity home in the United States was established in the South Bronx area of New York City, and by 1984 the congregation operated 19 establishments throughout the country.[71]
        <h2 id="awards">Awards</h2>
        <p>During her life, Mother Teresa receives more than 700 prizes for her charity work and she is the most awarded person 
            in the XXth centuryIn 1979, Mother Teresa received the Nobel Peace Prize "for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome
            poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat to peace".[118] She refused the conventional ceremonial banquet for
            laureates, asking that its $192,000 cost be given to the poor in India[119] and saying that earthly rewards were important only if they helped her to help the world's needy. 
            When Mother Teresa received the prize she was asked, "What can we do to promote world peace?" She answered, "Go home and love your family." 
            Building on this theme in her Nobel lecture, she said: "Around the world, not only in the poor countries, but I found the poverty of the West so much more difficult to remove. 
            When I pick up a person from the street, hungry, I give him a plate of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, 
            the person that has been thrown out from society – that poverty is so hurtable [sic] and so much, and I find that very difficult.".</p>
